1. Open Global Protect and make sure it is connected.
2. Click the menu icon in the top right and click "Refresh Connection."
3. Click the Gateway dropdown and click the second nearest gateway (Ex. LA -> SF).
4. Click the menu icon, click Settings, click "Sign Out", wait a second for the sign in window to pop up and try signing back in.
5. Click the menu icon, click "Disable", under "Reason:" just type in ".", once Global Protect is disabled press the "Enable" button.
